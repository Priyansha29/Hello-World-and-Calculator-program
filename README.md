EXPERIMENT-1:- Aim: Hello World & Calculator Program.

Apparatus: VS Code or Programiz online compiler

Theory: 
This experiment introduces the fundamental concepts of C++ programming through two simple programs:
"Hello World" and a basic calculator.
It covers the basic structure and syntax of a C++ program, including:
#include <iostream> – to access standard input/output functions.
main() function – the starting point of every C++ program.
Use of cout to print messages on the screen.
Use of cin to accept input from the user.

Demonstrates how to declare variables using appropriate data types:
float is used for decimal precision in arithmetic operations.
The calculator program performs the four basic arithmetic operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)

Helps understand the use of:
Arithmetic operators
User input/output
Variable storage and data flow

Provides hands-on experience with:
Writing, compiling, and executing a C++ program
Displaying results clearly using formatted output
These programs lay a strong foundation for further topics like:
Conditional statements, loops, and functions
Problem-solving using logic in C++

-->Program1: 
1)This program introduces the basic structure of a C++ program.

2)The line #include <iostream> includes the input-output stream library, allowing the use of cout and cin.

3)The function main() is the starting point of execution in every C++ program.

4)The statement cout << "Hello World"; is used to display output on the screen.

5)cout sends the given message to the console (standard output).

6)return 0; signals that the program has ended successfully.

-->Program2:

1)This program accepts two floating-point numbers from the user as input.

2)Two variables, num1 and num2, of type float are declared to store the inputs.

3)The cin statement is used to take input from the user via the keyboard.

4)The program performs four basic arithmetic operations:

a)Addition: num1 + num2 → stored in sum
b)Subtraction: num1 - num2 → stored in sub
c)Multiplication: num1 * num2 → stored in multi
d)Division: num1 / num2 → stored in div

5)Each result is displayed using the cout statement for output on the screen.

6)Using the float data type ensures decimal values are preserved in all calculations.

7)This program helps understand:
->How to declare and use variables
->How to take input/output using cin and cout
->How to perform arithmetic operations in C++
->The importance of choosing correct data types to maintain precision

Conclusion: Hence, we were able to print hello world and build a basic calculator in C++.
